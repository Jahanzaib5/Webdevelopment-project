#Online portal to search for Educational organizations

Identifying the problem:
Most of the students face problems while applying for different universities, as at first, they don’t have adequate information about the university’s admission process, its location, and its study environment. After that, the most important problem arises is the issue of money as students usually seek for some financial grant or scholarship to get into any university. Considering all these things, it is really hard for a student to find these information in one place, so that it will minimize the time consumption and effort to decide for a better future.
